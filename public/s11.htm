        <h2>Story: </h2>
        <p>
            Title: The Tell-Tale Heart It was a dark and stormy night, the kind that made one want
                 to curl up with a good book and a warm fire. But I, the narrator, was not to be so easily
                  swayed. I had a tale to tell, a tale of murder and madness, of the depths to which a man can 
                  sink when driven by eldritch horrors. I was once possessed by a fearful eye, an eye that perceived
                   the hidden truths of the universe, truths that no mortal was meant to know. It was an eye that saw
                    the secrets of the dead, the whispers of the grave, and the darkness that lurked in every corner. 
                    And I knew I could not bear it any longer. So I did what any self-respecting madman would do in my position:
                     I killed him. The old man, that is. He was a cruel and pitiless tyrant, a fiend who revelled in the suffering 
                     of others. And so I took matters into my own hands, and ended his wicked life. But the eye still haunts me, 
                     that accursed eye that saw all and judged all. It is a eye that cannot be forgotten, a eye that will not be 
                     silenced. And so I am forced to confess my crime, to reveal the shameful secrets of my soul to the world.
                      They will say I am mad, that I am delusional, that I am simply a raving lunatic. But they will be wrong. 
                      For I know the truth, and the truth is this: that there are forces beyond our understanding, forces that 
                      whisper to us in the dark, urging us to do their bidding. And I did their bidding, I did the unspeakable act 
                      that defiled my soul and stained my hands. And now I am left to face the consequences, to suffer the eternal
                      
                      torment of my own guilt. For I am the tell-tale heart, the beating heart that can never be still, the heart 
                      that betrays me with its every throb. But I will not repent, I will not apologize. For I am the master of my own fate, the architect of my own damnation. And I will tell my tale, 
                I will tell it to the end, for I am the tell-tale heart, and this is my story.
